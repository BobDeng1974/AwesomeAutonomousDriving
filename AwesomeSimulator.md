CARLA is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. 
CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems. 
In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. 
The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions.

## [Lgsvl](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator)

LG Electronics America R&D Center has developed an HDRP Unity-based multi-robot simulator for autonomous vehicle developers.
We provide an out-of-the-box solution which can meet the needs of developers wishing to focus on testing their autonomous vehicle algorithms. 
It currently has integration with TierIV's Autoware and Baidu's Apollo 5.0 and Apollo 3.0 platforms, can generate HD maps, 
and can be immediately used for testing and validation of a whole system with little need for custom integrations.
